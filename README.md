# NETFLIX-AP11

https://netflix-ap11.netlify.app/

<h3>GENERAL INFORMATION</h3>
This application has been created just for learning purposes with all copyright to Netflix Polska. The main goal has been to map original Netflix website and practice my skills in pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript. You can open the page by live-server extension.

<h3>FUNCTIONALITY</h3>
Whole page is functional and responsive up to ~250px. Currently the website has main page 'index.html' and a few subpages with different functionality. On the main page there are two forms with working validation. If you type valid e-mail and submit the form it will move you to the 'signup' page.<br><br>

From index.html you can also go to the 'login' page and there is login validation too. Here you can type three working accounts data:<br>

```
login: john.roller@example.com, password: 1234<br>
login: 568891231, password: PW1234<br>
login: jerry.buzzer@gmail.com, password: repeentacja1821<br>
```

Then, it will move you into the 'browse' page where you can choose your account. After choosing an account it will move you to the 'home' page where you will see a lot of movies, series and TV programmes which are fetched from https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs API. I don't want to dive deep into backend technologies at this stage of the study, so this website is built only with simple frontend technologies with session and local storage imitating backend data.

<h3>FEATURES TO DO</h3>
- i18n for English speaking users <br>
- simple frontend routing <br>
- possibility for creating new accounts <br>
- dig into details on 'home' page like managing, changing accounts and small improvments <br>
