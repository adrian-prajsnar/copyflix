# Netflix-ap11

https://netflix-ap11.netlify.app/

<h3>What is this project?</h3>
This application has been created just for learning purposes with all copyright to Netflix Polska. The main purpose was to map original Netflix website and pracitce my skills in pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript. You can open the page by live-server extension.

<h3>Functionality</h3>
Currently website has main page 'index.html' and a few subpages with different functionality. On the main page there are two forms with working validation. If you type valid e-mail and submit the form it will move you to the 'singup' page where in the future I will add possibility to create your own account.<br><br>

From the main page you can also go to the 'login' page and there is login validation too. Here you can type three working accounts data:<br>
login: john.roller@example.com, password: 1234<br>
login: 568891231, password: PW1234<br>
login: jerry.buzzer@gmail.com, password: repeentacja1821<br>

Then, it will move you into the 'browse' page where you can choose your account to watch. After choosing an account it will move you to the 'home' page where you will see
a lot of movies and series to watch. I don't want to go deep into backend technologies at this stage of the study, so this website will be built only with simple frontend
technologies. 

<h3>Future features</h3>
In the future I will also add some local/session storages features so this page will be more functional. Also there has to be added media queries in some pages
and a few small changes to make this project better. After this project I will start learning javascript framework and move to the more complex projects.<br><br>

<i>Thank you!</i>
