## Description

Netflix-ap11 is an educational project developed solely for learning purposes, with all copyrights belonging to Netflix Polska. The primary objective behind this project is to mirror the functionality of the original Netflix website while honing skills in pure **HTML, CSS, & JavaScript**.

**Features:**

- Responsive Design: The entire webpage is fully functional and responsive, adapting seamlessly to screen sizes of up to approximately 250px.
- Page Structure: The website comprises a main page, 'index.html,' and multiple subpages, each offering distinct functionality.
- User Registration: On the main page, two forms with functional validation allow users to register. Submitting a valid email address redirects users to the 'signup' page.
- User Login: Users can also access a 'login' page from 'index.html.' It includes login validation and provides three pre-configured test accounts for user convenience: <br>
  _a. login: john.roller@example.com, password: 1234 <br>
  b. login: 568891231, password: PW1234 <br>
  c. login: jerry.buzzer@gmail.com, password: repeentacja1821_
- Profile Selection: Upon successful login, users can select their account, which then redirects them to the 'home' page.
- Content Library: The 'home' page displays a diverse collection of movies, series, and TV programs, all sourced from the https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs API. Users can explore a wide array of entertainment content.
- Frontend Emulation: Netflix-ap11 offers a frontend-focused experience with session and local storage, effectively simulating backend data. This approach facilitates skill development in frontend technologies without the need for complex backend systems.

**Future feature ideas:**

- i18n Support: Consider adding internationalization (i18n) support to cater to English-speaking users, allowing for a more inclusive experience.
- User Account Creation: Enhance user engagement by implementing user account creation functionality, enabling users to create their accounts.
- Enhanced 'Home' Page: Dive deeper into the details on the 'home' page, allowing users to manage and make account changes, while also incorporating minor improvements to enhance the user experience.
